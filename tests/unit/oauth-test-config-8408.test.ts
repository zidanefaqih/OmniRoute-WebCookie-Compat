// #8408: Guard against missing OAUTH_TEST_CONFIG entries for OAuth providers

// NOT a design decision — this is a grandfathered backlog. These six ids are simply the
// providers that still lack an OAUTH_TEST_CONFIG entry today, captured so this guard can be
// enforced from now on without a big-bang change. Each one is a candidate for the same
// treatment devin-cli and agy get here; removing an id from this list is the fix, not a
// regression. Do not add new ids to it — a provider added without a test config should fail
// this test at the time it is added, which is the entire point.

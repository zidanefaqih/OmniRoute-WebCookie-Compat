/**
 * Guards the executor override signatures fixed for TS 7 readiness.
 *
 * Three executors declared a *private/protected* `buildHeaders()` helper whose signature
 * has nothing to do with `BaseExecutor.buildHeaders(credentials, stream?, clientHeaders?,
 * model?, health?)`:
 *
 *   hailuo-web  (token: string, yy: string)
 *   lmarena     (_model: string, credentials: unknown, _body: unknown)
 *   qwen-web    (token: string, cookieHeader: string, chatId?: string)
 *
 * They were name collisions, not overrides — each shadowed the inherited member with an
 * incompatible signature (TS2416). `BaseExecutor` calls `this.buildHeaders(credentials,
 * false)` from `countTokens()`, so the shadow sat on a live dispatch path; it was never
 * reached only because `buildCountTokensUrl()` returns null unless `config.format` is
 * `"claude"`, and none of these three is. Latent rather than live — but one `format`
 * change away from passing a credentials object where a token string was expected.
 *
 * The helpers are renamed, so these assertions pin both halves: the inherited method is
 * no longer shadowed, and the early return that kept it harmless still holds.

/**
 * Scope guard for the deliberate NVIDIA validation proxy bypass (#3226).
 *
 * Context: NVIDIA's API-key validation endpoint stalls when routed through the
 * global proxy/TLS-patched fetch (undici dispatcher → 504). As a documented
 * exception, `directHttpsRequest()` in `src/lib/providers/validation.ts` calls
 * `safeOutboundFetch({ bypassProxyPatch: true })`, which resolves the native
 * fetch reference via `getOriginalFetch()` and bypasses the patch for that one
 * validation call only.
 *
 * This test asserts that the bypass is CONFINED to the validation path and has
 * NOT silently spread to the chat hot path (chatHelpers / chatCore).
 *
 * See also: tests/unit/nvidia-validation-bypass-proxy-3226.test.ts (mechanism seam tests).

# OmniRoute Roadmap

> Version-gated, not date-gated: each milestone ships when its quality gates pass.
> Current line: **v3.8.x** (this branch). Last updated: 2026-07-23.

OmniRoute is heading from a monolithic router to a **modular AI platform**: a lightweight
core engine, a typed SDK, and everything else as installable modules and plugins. The path
runs through a stabilization rail (3.8.50 → 3.8.59), an LTS anchor (**3.9.0**), and the
modular **4.0**.

## The rail at a glance

```
3.8.50 ─ 3.8.54   PREPARE   non-breaking structural prep (all PRs welcome)
3.8.55 ─ 3.8.59   VALIDATE  stabilization (fixes / docs / i18n / providers only)
3.9.0             LTS       stable/v3 branch · long-term support line
4.0.0-nightly/rc  MODULAR   core + SDK + modules + marketplace (develop branch)
4.0.0             GA        latest switches to v4 · v3 stays supported as LTS
```

## Phase 1 — Preparation (3.8.50 → 3.8.54)

Non-breaking structural work that de-risks the modular split. Every version closes with a
mandatory quality-gate battery before new merges open.

| Version | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| 3.8.50 | CI safety net on release branches · dead-code cleanup · community-reported catalog/topology bug fixes · contributor "golden path" guide |
| 3.8.51 | Executor registry (in-place) · end-to-end provider-journey contract test becomes a CI gate · official scoped-test dev loop · CI lane consolidation (shared install/setup across gate jobs, #8084) |
| 3.8.52 | `combo.ts` decomposition · routing-strategy registry · unified model-catalog contract for `/v1/models` · one CI policy for PRs to `release/**` and `main` (#8084) |
| 3.8.53 | `chatCore.ts` decomposition · headless mode (`OMNIROUTE_HEADLESS=1`) · local candidate build/promote loop |
| 3.8.54 | Release infrastructure (dormant): channels, labels, PR templates, merge queue · full-regression authority moves to the merge queue once TIA shadow evidence clears (#8084) · public feature-freeze announcement |

## Phase 2 — Validation (3.8.55 → 3.8.59)

**External feature PRs pause here** (they get the `v4-feature` label and are re-targeted to
the v4 channel when it opens). Fixes, docs, i18n, and provider updates keep flowing.

| Version | Focus |
| --- | --- |
| 3.8.55 | Characterization tests for every extraction candidate · coupling re-measurement |
| 3.8.56 | Extended canary · performance baselines (heap, TTFB, build) |
| 3.8.57 | Security & compliance sweep · publish provenance (OIDC) rehearsal |
| 3.8.58 | Full dry-run of the 3.9.0 cut (branches, channels, forward-port) — includes the PR preview-artifact + build-once promotion rehearsal (#8084) |
| 3.8.59 | Final freeze · full-suite audit · GO/NO-GO |

## Phase 3 — v3.9.0 LTS

After 3.8.59 the next version is **3.9.0** (there is no 3.8.60). It creates the long-lived
branch model:

- **`stable/v3`** — the LTS line (3.9.x). Receives fixes, security patches, and provider
  updates. `npm install omniroute` (aka `latest`) stays on v3 during the whole v4 cycle.
- **`develop`** — v4 development, published as `4.0.0-nightly.*`.
- **`main`** — v4 release candidates (`next`) and, eventually, GA.
- Fixes merged to `stable/v3` are automatically forward-ported to `develop` with full
  contributor credit (`Co-authored-by`).

New features land in the v4 channel. The LTS line is stability-first.

## Phase 4 — v4.0: the modular platform

The monolith is intentionally disassembled on `develop`:

- **`@omniroute/core`** (npm name stays `omniroute`) — just the engine: `/v1/*`, routing,
  combo/fallback, providers.
- **`@omniroute/sdk`** — one typed contract: hooks, extension points, two-phase lifecycle,
  UI contributions. The five extension systems that exist today (plugins, CLI plugins,
  skills, MCP tools, A2A skills) collapse into one declarative manifest.
- **Modules** (`@omniroute/mod-*`) — cloud agents, traffic inspection (MITM), evals,
  webhooks, memory, guardrails, observability and more move out of the core, each with its
  own version and lifecycle.
- **Providers as plugins** — adding a provider stops touching the core.
- **Marketplace** — one-click install with verified integrity (hash pinning, signing,
  sandbox). Free in v1; a paid tier later with revenue share for creators.
- Ships as `4.0.0-nightly.*` → `4.0.0-rc.N` (soak in production) → **4.0.0 GA**, when
  `latest` switches to v4 and v3 enters its announced LTS support window.

**The core is MIT and free, forever.**

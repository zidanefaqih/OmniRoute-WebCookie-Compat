# Providers Guide: Connect AI Models to OmniRoute

> **TL;DR**: A provider is a connection to an AI service (like OpenAI, Anthropic, Google). You need at least one provider to use OmniRoute.

## What Is a Provider?

Think of a provider like a **phone carrier**. Just as you need a phone carrier to make calls, you need an AI provider to use AI models. OmniRoute is like a phone that works with **all carriers** — you can switch between them automatically.

## Using Multiple Providers

OmniRoute works best with **multiple providers**. This gives you:

- **Automatic fallback** — If one provider fails, OmniRoute tries the next
- **Cost optimization** — OmniRoute picks the cheapest provider for each request
- **Speed optimization** — OmniRoute picks the fastest provider for each request
- **Quality optimization** — OmniRoute picks the best provider for each task

### Recommended Setup

Connect at least **3 providers** for the best experience:

1. **One free provider** (Kiro, OpenCode Free, or Pollinations) — Always available
2. **One fast provider** (Groq, Cerebras) — For quick responses
3. **One quality provider** (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) — For complex tasks

Then use `model: "auto"` and OmniRoute will automatically pick the best one for each request.

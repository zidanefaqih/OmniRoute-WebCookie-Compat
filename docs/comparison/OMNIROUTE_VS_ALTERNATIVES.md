## When to choose OmniRoute

- You self-host and want **maximum provider coverage** (237+, 90+ with a free tier)
- You need a **built-in MCP server** (LLM tools, memory, skills exposed as tools)
- You need **A2A protocol** for agent-to-agent workflows
- You want **fingerprint stealth** (JA3/JA4) to avoid detection by upstream CAPTCHAs
- You need **enterprise features** (guardrails, evals, audit trail) without a SaaS bill

## When to choose LiteLLM

- You're **Python-first** and need tight integration with `litellm.completion()`
- You need **mature production deployment recipes** (k8s, Helm charts)
- Your team already runs Python microservices

## When to choose OpenRouter (SaaS)

- You don't want to self-host
- You're fine paying per-token at SaaS markup
- You need a **single payment method** across all providers

## When to choose Portkey

- You need a **commercial SLA** with uptime guarantees
- You prefer a **managed dashboard** without ops overhead
- You need **enterprise compliance** features out of the box

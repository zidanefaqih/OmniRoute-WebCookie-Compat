/**
 * Fusion combo strategy — parallel panel + judge synthesis.
 *
 * A fusion combo fans the prompt out to every panel model in parallel, then a
 * configurable judge model synthesizes one final answer from all panel responses.
 *
 *   - quorum-grace collection caps the straggler penalty (the slowest model
 *     otherwise dominates wall time);
 *   - anonymized sources prevent judge brand-bias ("Source N" rather than model name);
 *   - degrades to a direct answer on a single survivor, 503 on total failure.
 *
 * Per OpenRouter's Fusion design, the judge does NOT merge — it analyzes
 * (consensus / contradictions / partial coverage / unique insights / blind spots)
 * then writes one answer grounded in that analysis. Most of fusion's quality lift
 * comes from this synthesis step.
 *
 * Ported from upstream decolua/9router (Daniil Schovkunov), adapted JS → TS and
 * wired through OmniRoute's existing combo schema (combo.config.judgeModel /
 * combo.config.fusionTuning).

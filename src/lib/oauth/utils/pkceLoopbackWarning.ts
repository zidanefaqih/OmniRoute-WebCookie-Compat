/**
 * #8046: PKCE_CALLBACK_SERVER_PROVIDERS (codex/xai-oauth/grok-cli) register a FIXED
 * loopback redirect_uri (e.g. http://localhost:1455/auth/callback for codex) with the
 * upstream OAuth app. That redirect only resolves on the machine actually running the
 * browser, not on whatever host serves the OmniRoute dashboard.
 *
 * OAuthModal's `isTrueLocalhost` check (hostname === "localhost" || "127.0.0.1") only
 * covers one such case. A dashboard reached via a LAN IP (192.168.*, 10.*, 172.16-31.*)
 * is `isLocalhost: true, isTrueLocalhost: false` — the callback-server branch was falling
 * straight through to the standard authorize flow and window.open()ing an authUrl whose
 * embedded redirect_uri can never resolve, with zero warning (reported as a silent
 * Auth0 `invalid_state` failure with no server-side log line).
 *
 * Extracted out of OAuthModal.tsx (frozen file-size baseline) so the guard has an
 * isolated, unit-testable home. Mirrors the messaging pattern of the sibling
 * remote-origin hint added for #7523 (`remoteOAuthHint.ts::buildRemoteOAuthHint`).
 *
 * Follow-up: the guard stops the doomed flow correctly, but explaining it as one long
 * sentence in the generic red error step left the operator to work out *which* ports to
 * forward. `buildPkceLoopbackMismatchHint()` returns the same diagnosis as structured
 * data — including a copy-pasteable `ssh -L` command with the detected host and both
 * ports already filled in — so the modal can render an organized panel instead.
